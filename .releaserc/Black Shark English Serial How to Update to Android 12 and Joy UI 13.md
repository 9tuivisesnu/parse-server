Black Shark was a short-lived but influential TV series that aired on ABC from 1974 to 1975. It was one of the first shows to depict the Vietnam War from a critical perspective, and to explore the themes of anti-war activism, youth culture, and counterculture. Starring Lee Majors, Thomas Magnum, and Don Luce, the show revolved around an American college professor who trained a bunch of bright-eyed kids to avoid the Vietnam draft in the 1960s. The music that was composed for the show featured cameos by other famous artists, including The Beach Boys and Richie Valens[^3^].
 
Despite its popularity among young viewers, Black Shark was canceled after only one season due to low ratings and pressure from conservative groups. The show was also criticized for being too violent, too political, and too unrealistic. However, many fans and critics consider Black Shark to be a cult classic that paved the way for other groundbreaking shows like M\*A\*S\*H, The A-Team, and Magnum P.I. Some of the actors and writers who worked on Black Shark went on to have successful careers in Hollywood, such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Harrison Ford.
