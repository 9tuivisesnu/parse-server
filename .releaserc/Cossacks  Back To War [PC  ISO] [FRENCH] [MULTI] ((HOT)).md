- Choose a nation that suits your playstyle. Each nation has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique units and buildings. For example, France has powerful cavalry and artillery, but weak infantry and navy. Turkey has strong infantry and navy, but weak cavalry and artillery. You can check the encyclopedia for more details on each nation.
- Build a balanced economy. You will need food, wood, stone, gold, iron, and coal to produce units and buildings. You can gather these resources from mines, mills, farms, markets, and trade ships. You should also build storehouses near your resource sites to increase the efficiency of your workers.
- Research technologies as soon as possible. Technologies can improve your units' attack, defense, speed, range, and fire rate. They can also unlock new units and buildings. You can research technologies at the academy, the blacksmith, the stable, the artillery depot, and the shipyard.
- Use formations and tactics. Formations can give your units bonuses or penalties depending on their type and position. For example, a square formation can protect your infantry from cavalry charges, but it makes them vulnerable to artillery fire. You can also use tactics such as flanking, ambushes, feints, and retreats to gain an advantage over your enemy.
