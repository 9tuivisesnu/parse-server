## Step 1: Design your character
 
The first step is to design your character's appearance and personality. You can use any drawing tool you like, such as Photoshop or Paint, to sketch out your character's face, hair, eyes, clothes, and accessories. You can also use online tools like [Naruto Character Maker by Hapuriainen](https://www.numuki.com/game/hapuriainen-naruto-character-maker/) or [Naruto Character Creation Game](https://www.y8.com/games/naruto_character_creation) to get some inspiration and ideas. Try to make your character unique and original, but also fit in with the Naruto universe.
 
## Step 2: Import your character into Flash
 
The next step is to import your character's image into Flash. You can do this by opening Flash and creating a new document. Then, go to File > Import > Import to Stage and select your character's image file. You will see your character appear on the stage, which is the area where you will create your animation or game. You can resize and position your character as you like using the transform tool.
 
## Step 3: Convert your character into a symbol
 
The third step is to convert your character into a symbol, which is a reusable object that can be animated and manipulated in Flash. To do this, select your character on the stage and press F8 on your keyboard. A window will pop up where you can name your symbol and choose its type. For this game, we will use a movie clip symbol, which is a type of symbol that can contain multiple frames and animations. Name your symbol "Character" and click OK.
 
## Step 4: Add interactivity to your character
 
The fourth step is to add interactivity to your character, which means making it respond to user input such as mouse clicks or keyboard presses. To do this, we will use ActionScript, which is a programming language that controls the behavior of Flash objects. To open the ActionScript panel, go to Window > Actions or press F9 on your keyboard. You will see a window where you can write code for your character.

For this game, we will make our character change its appearance when the user clicks on different buttons. To do this, we will need to create some buttons on the stage and give them names. For example, we can create a button that changes the character's hair color and name it "HairButton". We can also create buttons for changing the character's eye color, clothing color, and accessories.
 
Then, we will write some code for each button that tells it what to do when it is clicked. For example, for the HairButton, we can write:
 `HairButton.onRelease = function() 
  //this code runs when the HairButton is clicked
  //choose a random number between 1 and 4
  var randomColor = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1;
  //use the random number to change the character's hair color
  if (randomColor == 1) 
    Character.hair.gotoAndStop("red");
   else if (randomColor == 2) 
    Character.hair.gotoAndStop("blue");
   else if (randomColor == 3) 
    Character.hair.gotoAndStop("green");
   else if (randomColor == 4) 
    Character.hair.gotoAndStop("yellow");
  
;
` 
This code uses a function called onRelease, which runs when the button is released after being clicked. It also uses a variable called randomColor, which stores a random number between 1 and 4. It then uses an if-else statement to check the value of randomColor and change the character's hair color accordingly.
 
We can write
