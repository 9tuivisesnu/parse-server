In this article, we will give you an overview of each plugin in the bundle and how they can improve your audio quality and workflow.
 
## SPL-IZER
 
The SPL-IZER is an adjustable 3 band 24db per octave FIR (Finite Impulse Response) frequency splitter that allows you to isolate and route the three bands to aux or instrument tracks for separate processing. This can give you more flexibility and control over your sound, as you can apply different effects and dynamics to each band. For example, you can add distortion to the low band, reverb to the mid band, and delay to the high band.
 
## INSPECTOR XL
 
The INSPECTOR XL is a collection of six individual powerful audio analysis tools designed to fulfill a number of familiar analysis tasks with professionalism, style and finesse. It includes a spectrum analyzer, a phase scope, a peak and RMS level meter, a correlation meter, a loudness meter, and a clipping indicator. With these tools, you can monitor your audio signal in real time and detect any potential problems or issues that might affect your mix or master.
 
## DYNAM-IZER
 
The DYNAM-IZER is not your typical multi-band compressor. It is an entirely different beast that lets you break your audio levels up into "zones" and apply different compression settings to each zone. This way, you can tailor your compression to the dynamics of your audio material and avoid over-compressing or under-compressing any part of your signal. For example, you can compress the louder levels with a quick attack, expand the lower levels with a slow release, and leave the mid level sounds alone.
 
## DETAILER
 
The DETAILER is a stereo mastering tool or final mix plugin for the master fader. It combines a three band limiter and dynamic widening psycho acoustic processing to increase the perception of detail and loudness in your audio. It is designed to be easy to use and effective with minimal adjustments. Roger Nichols has fine tuned the process to produce the most optimal results for any type of audio.
 
## FINIS
 
The FINIS is a peak limiter and bit-depth re-quantizer that can help you control your audio levels and prevent distortion from rearing its ugly head. It can also help you maximize your audio's loudness by using multi-band dynamics processing and dithering. Whether you just need to catch an occasional over or to increase the average level of your audio, FINIS offers a flexible solution that can handle any level of loudness without audible distortion.

## FREQUAL-IZER
 
The FREQUAL-IZER is a complex FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter that lets you build your own custom EQ curve. You can see the results of your EQ with the built-in spectrum analyzer and adjust the frequency, gain, and bandwidth of each filter node. Unlike conventional EQs that introduce non-linear phase shift and color your audio, FREQUAL-IZER preserves the phase integrity and transparency of your audio.
 
## UNIQUEL-IZER
 
The UNIQUEL-IZER is an EQ plugin that lets you determine your ideal EQ configuration without being limited by preset bands or filters. You can add as many bands or filters as you need with a simple click and adjust their parameters with ease. You can also choose from different filter types, such as low pass, high pass, band pass, notch, shelf, or parametric.
 
## UNIQUEL-IZER LE
 
The UNIQUEL-IZER LE is a simplified version of the UNIQUEL-IZER that uses the same advanced algorithms but with a fixed number of seven filters. It is ideal for quick and easy EQ adjustments without compromising
