1. Locate the serial number on your planter. The serial number is usually located on a metal plate or sticker on the planter frame, hitch, or tongue. It may also be stamped on the planter itself.
2. Compare the serial number with the chart on this website[^1^]. This chart shows the model year and serial number range for different JD planter models. For example, if your serial number is A01745X700001, you have a 1745 planter that was made in 2017.
3. If your planter model or serial number is not listed on the chart, you can contact your local JD dealer or customer service for assistance. They may be able to provide you with more information about your planter based on the serial number.

Knowing the year of your JD planter can help you order the right parts and accessories, as well as maintain and repair your planter properly. It can also help you estimate the value and lifespan of your planter.

## How to Maintain and Repair Your JD Planter
 
Your JD planter is a valuable investment that can help you achieve high yields and profitability. However, like any other machine, it requires regular maintenance and repair to keep it in optimal condition. Here are some tips on how to maintain and repair your JD planter:

- Follow the operator's manual and the planter inspection checklist[^3^] for your specific planter model. These documents provide detailed instructions on how to perform routine checks, adjustments, lubrication, and cleaning of your planter components.
- Use genuine JD parts and accessories when replacing or upgrading your planter parts. JD parts are designed and tested to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. They also come with a warranty and support from your JD dealer.
- Check your planter tires, chains, idlers, drive shafts, bearings, coulters, disk openers, seed tubes, closing wheels, and seed boxes regularly for wear and damage. Replace or repair any parts that are worn smaller than the recommended specifications or that show signs of cracking, bending, or breaking.
- Calibrate your seed meters and monitor system before each planting season. This will ensure accurate seed placement and population control. You can use a hydraulic orbit motor attached to a jack stand to turn the drive shafts and test the seed meters. You can also use a seed meter test stand or a mobile seed meter testing service to calibrate your seed meters.
- Clean your planter after each use and store it in a dry and covered place. Remove any dirt, dust, debris, or seeds from the planter parts. Apply a light coat of oil or grease to prevent rust and corrosion. Cover your planter with a tarp or a cover to protect it from sunlight, moisture, rodents, and insects.

Maintaining and repairing your JD planter can help you extend its lifespan, reduce downtime, save costs, and improve your planting efficiency and results. If you need any assistance or advice on how to maintain and repair your JD planter, you can contact your local JD dealer or customer service.
