## PyCharm Professional 2018.1.3 Features
 
PyCharm Professional 2018.1.3 is the latest version of PyCharm that was released on May 15, 2018[^2^]. It includes several improvements and bug fixes that enhance the performance and usability of the IDE. Some of the notable features are:
 
- **Python Console Messages**: PyCharm now folds the startup messages of the Python interpreter in the Python console, giving you more room to write your own code.
