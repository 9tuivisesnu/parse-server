Lake Placid 3 - Calma apparente is the third movie in a series that started as a homage to the classic creature features of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and Jaws. The original Lake Placid was written by David E. Kelley, the creator of popular TV shows like Ally McBeal and Boston Legal, and featured witty dialogue, quirky characters and a tongue-in-cheek approach to the genre. The sequel and the third film, however, abandoned most of the humor and satire, and focused more on delivering cheap thrills and shocks.
 
Lake Placid 3 - Calma apparente is not a film for everyone. It is a low-budget production that does not offer much in terms of plot, character development or cinematography. The acting is mediocre at best, and some of the dialogue is laughable. The film also contains several clichÃ©s and stereotypes, such as the horny teenagers, the greedy poachers, the clueless sheriff and the heroic game warden. The film does not take itself too seriously, though, and some viewers may find it enjoyable as a guilty pleasure or a mindless entertainment.
 
Lake Placid 3 - Calma apparente is rated R for bloody creature violence, which means that it contains several scenes of graphic gore and mutilation. The film does not shy away from showing the crocodiles tearing apart their victims, sometimes in slow motion or close-up. The film also features some nudity and sexual content, mostly involving female characters who are either topless or wearing skimpy outfits. The film does not have much artistic or social value, but it may appeal to fans of horror, gore and exploitation cinema.
