# What is the FIDIC Gold Book Contract Guide and How to Use It?
  
The FIDIC Gold Book Contract Guide is a document that provides guidance and commentary on the FIDIC Conditions of Contract for Design, Build and Operate Projects (DBO), also known as the Gold Book. The Gold Book is a form of contract that covers the entire life cycle of a project, from design and construction to operation and maintenance. It is suitable for projects that require a high level of integration and coordination between the contractor and the employer, such as water treatment plants, power stations, airports, railways, etc.
  
The FIDIC Gold Book Contract Guide was published in 2011 by the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC), an organization that represents the interests of engineering and consulting firms worldwide. The guide aims to help users understand the rationale and intentions behind the clauses and provisions of the Gold Book, as well as to provide practical examples and tips on how to apply them in different situations. The guide is not a substitute for the contract itself, but rather a complementary tool that can assist parties in drafting, negotiating and administering their contracts.
