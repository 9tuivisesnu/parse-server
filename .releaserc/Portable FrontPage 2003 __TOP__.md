# How to Make Your Own Portable FrontPage 2003
 
FrontPage 2003 is a popular web design software that was released by Microsoft in 2003. It allows users to create and edit websites using a graphical interface, without having to write code. However, FrontPage 2003 is not a portable application, which means that it cannot be run from a USB drive or other removable media. This can be inconvenient for users who want to work on their websites from different computers or locations.
 
Fortunately, there are some ways to make your own portable version of FrontPage 2003, using some tools and techniques that are available online. In this article, we will show you two methods to do so: one using a launcher made by a community member, and another using a portable app creator software. Both methods require that you have a legal copy of FrontPage 2003 installed on your computer.

## Method 1: Using a Launcher
 
A launcher is a small program that can run another program from a different location, without installing it on the system. There are some launchers that are designed specifically for FrontPage 2003, such as the one created by user darkX3536 on PortableApps.com[^1^]. To use this method, you will need to download the launcher from the link provided in the forum thread[^1^], and follow these steps:
 
1. Extract the launcher files to a folder on your USB drive or other removable media.
2. Copy the entire folder of FrontPage 2003 from your computer (usually located at C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11) to the same folder where you extracted the launcher files.
3. Rename the folder of FrontPage 2003 to "App".
4. Run the launcher file (FrontPagePortable.exe) from the folder on your USB drive or other removable media.

This method should allow you to run FrontPage 2003 from any computer that has Windows XP or later. However, there are some limitations and risks involved with this method. First, you may break the Microsoft Office EULA by doing this[^1^]. Second, the launcher is not endorsed by the PortableApps project, and there is no support provided except by the launcher's creator[^1^]. Third, some features of FrontPage 2003 may not work properly or at all when run from a different location[^1^]. Therefore, use this method at your own discretion and risk.
 
## Method 2: Using a Portable App Creator Software
 
A portable app creator software is a program that can convert any installed application into a portable one, by copying its files and registry entries to a different location. There are several portable app creator software available online, such as Portable Apps Creator (PAC), Cameyo, ThinApp, and more. For this method, we will use PAC as an example. To use this method, you will need to download PAC from its official website[^2^], and follow these steps:

1. Run PAC on your computer where FrontPage 2003 is installed.
2. Select "Create Portable App" from the main menu.
3. Select "FrontPage 2003" from the list of installed applications.
4. Select a destination folder on your USB drive or other removable media where you want to save the portable app.
5. Click "Create" and wait for the process to finish.

This method should create a portable app of FrontPage 2003 that can be run from any computer that has Windows XP or later. However, there are some limitations and risks involved with this method as well. First, you may break the Microsoft Office EULA by doing this[^2^]. Second, some features of FrontPage 2003 may not work properly or at all when run from a different location[^2^]. Third, some portable app creator software may contain malware or adware that can harm your computer or privacy[^2^]. Therefore, use this method at your own discretion and risk.
