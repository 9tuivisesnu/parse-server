# How to Improve Your Japanese Speaking Skills with Shadowing
 
Do you want to speak Japanese more fluently and naturally? Do you want to improve your listening and pronunciation skills? If so, you might want to try a learning technique called shadowing.
 
Shadowing is a form of training that is designed to help improve simultaneous interpretation. However, its effectiveness is not limited to this area and with its simple method, beginner students will also gain great value from it[^2^]. Shadowing involves listening to a voice recording of a native speaker and repeating what they say as closely as possible. By doing this, you can train your ears to catch the nuances of the language and your mouth to produce the sounds correctly.

One of the best resources for shadowing Japanese is a series of books called *Shadowing: Let's Speak Japanese!*. These books contain natural dialogues that are fun to follow, starting from the beginner level and going up to the advanced level. Each dialogue comes with a CD that has both normal and slow speed versions. The books also have complete translations into English, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese[^1^].
 
If you want to try shadowing with these books, here are some tips to follow:
 
- Choose a dialogue that matches your level and interest. You can preview some sample pages and listen to some sample voices on the publisher's website[^1^].
- Listen to the dialogue once without repeating. Try to understand the main idea and the context.
- Listen to the dialogue again and repeat after each sentence. Try to mimic the speaker's intonation, rhythm, and accent. Don't worry if you don't understand every word or grammar point.
- Listen to the dialogue again and repeat along with the speaker. Try to keep up with the speed and match the voice as closely as possible.
- Review the dialogue by reading the transcript and the translation. Look up any unfamiliar words or grammar points.
- Repeat the steps above until you feel comfortable with the dialogue. You can also try shadowing with different dialogues or different levels.

By practicing shadowing regularly, you will be able to improve your Japanese speaking skills in a fun and effective way. You will also learn new vocabulary, expressions, and conversations that you can use in real life situations. So why not give it a try?
