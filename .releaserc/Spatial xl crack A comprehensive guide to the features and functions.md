## Spatial Business Intelligence
 
Spatial business intelligence is the process of integrating spatial data and analysis with traditional business data and analytics. It enables you to gain insights into the spatial patterns, trends, and relationships that affect your business performance. SpatialXL is a spatial BI tool that lets you create interactive maps and dashboards in Excel using your own data or data from various sources such as databases, web services, or files. You can also use SpatialXL's StoryBoard feature to create dynamic presentations that tell a compelling story with your data.
 
Some of the benefits of using SpatialXL for spatial BI include:
 
- Easy to use: You don't need any GIS or mapping skills to use SpatialXL. You can simply drag and drop your data onto a map and customize it with different styles, colors, symbols, labels, and filters.
- Flexible: You can work with any type of spatial data, such as points, lines, polygons, rasters, or 3D models. You can also combine multiple layers of data on the same map and perform spatial operations such as buffering, intersecting, or aggregating.
- Interactive: You can zoom, pan, rotate, or tilt your map to explore it from different angles. You can also select features on the map and see their attributes in Excel or vice versa. You can also create interactive charts and tables that link to your map.
- Powerful: You can perform advanced spatial analysis such as heat maps, cluster analysis, hotspot detection, nearest neighbor analysis, or drive time analysis. You can also use SpatialXL's formula engine to create custom calculations and expressions based on your spatial data.

## Mining Solutions
 
Mining is a complex and challenging industry that requires accurate and reliable spatial data and analysis. SpatialXL is a mining solution that helps you manage, analyze, display, and enhance your mining data in Excel. You can work with data from various sources such as drill holes, boreholes, surveys, geophysics, geology, or engineering. You can also use SpatialXL's StoryBoard feature to create stunning 3D presentations that showcase your mining projects.
