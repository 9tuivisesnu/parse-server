Fortunately, there are some ways to play Stronghold 2 Deluxe without a CD. One of them is to use a No-CD patch or a fixed EXE file that bypasses the CD check. These files can be found on various websites that offer game fixes, such as GameCopyWorld, GameBurnWorld, and MegaGames. However, you should be careful when downloading and using these files, as they may contain viruses or malware, or may not work with your game version. You should also make a backup of your original game files before replacing them with the patched ones.
 
Another way to play Stronghold 2 Deluxe without a CD is to use a virtual drive software that creates a virtual CD-ROM on your computer. This software can mount an image file of your game CD, such as an ISO or BIN file, and make it appear as if you have inserted the CD in your drive. Some examples of virtual drive software are Daemon Tools, Alcohol 120%, and PowerISO. You can create an image file of your game CD using a CD burning software, such as Nero or ImgBurn, or download one from the internet. However, you should be aware that downloading or distributing copyrighted material without permission is illegal and may result in legal consequences.
 
Whichever method you choose to play Stronghold 2 Deluxe without a CD, you should always respect the rights of the game developers and publishers, and only use these methods for personal and non-commercial purposes. You should also avoid playing online with a patched or cracked game, as this may result in being banned from the game servers or violating the terms of service. If you enjoy playing Stronghold 2 Deluxe, you should consider buying the game from a legitimate source, such as Steam or GOG.com, where you can download and play the game without needing a CD.

Now that you know how to play Stronghold 2 Deluxe without a CD, you may want to learn some gameplay tips to improve your skills and enjoy the game more. Stronghold 2 Deluxe offers two modes of gameplay: peace and war. In peace mode, you can focus on building your economy, managing your population, and creating a beautiful castle. In war mode, you can engage in battles with other lords, defend your castle from invaders, and conquer new territories.
 
Some general gameplay tips for both modes are:
 
- Plan your castle layout carefully. You want to have enough space for your buildings, walls, towers, and farms, but also avoid creating bottlenecks or gaps in your defenses. You can use the pause button to plan your construction without wasting time or resources.
- Balance your production and consumption. You need to produce enough food, ale, weapons, armor, and other goods to satisfy your population and army, but also avoid overproducing or underproducing anything. You can use the granary and stockpile menus to check your supply and demand levels.
- Keep your popularity high. Your popularity determines how happy or unhappy your peasants are. If your popularity is too low, they will leave your castle or rebel against you. You can increase your popularity by providing enough food, ale, entertainment, religion, justice, and housing quality. You can also lower taxes or give out bribes.
- Use the honor system wisely. Honor is a currency that you can use to buy estates, promotions, mercenaries, and other benefits. You can earn honor by holding feasts, dances, jousts, and tournaments. You can also gain honor by completing missions or objectives.

Some specific gameplay tips for war mode are:

- Choose your troops carefully. Different troops have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, archers are good at long range but weak in melee combat; swordsmen are good at melee combat but slow and expensive; pikemen are good at defending walls but vulnerable to cavalry; etc. You should also consider the terrain and the enemy's troops when choosing your troops.
- Use siege equipment effectively. Siege equipment can help you break through enemy defenses or defend your own castle. For example, catapults can destroy enemy walls and towers; battering rams can break enemy gates; mantlets can protect your troops from enemy fire; etc. You should also protect your siege equipment from enemy attacks.
- Use fire strategically. Fire can be a powerful weapon or a dangerous hazard. You can use fire to burn enemy buildings, farms, or siege equipment; or to create a diversion or a trap. However, you should also be careful not to set fire to your own buildings or allies; or to let the fire spread uncontrollably.
- Use spies and assassins covertly. Spies and assassins can help you gather information or sabotage enemy operations. For example, spies can infiltrate enemy castles and reveal their layout, troops, and resources; assassins can kill enemy lords or important units; etc. However, you should also be careful not to let your spies or assassins be detected or killed by the enemy.

These are some of the basic tips and tricks for playing Stronghold 2 Deluxe. There are many more advanced strategies and tactics that you can learn by playing the game yourself or watching other players online. Have fun!
