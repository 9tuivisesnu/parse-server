Unani medicine is based on the concept of four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) that govern the body's functions and temperament. According to Unani medicine, health is a state of balance among these humors, while disease is a result of their imbalance or corruption. Unani medicine aims to restore the equilibrium of the humors by using natural substances, such as herbs, minerals, animal products, etc., as well as lifestyle modifications, such as diet, exercise, hygiene, etc.
