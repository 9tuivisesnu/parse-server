## Season 1 (2007-2008)
 
The first season of The Big Bang Theory introduces us to the main characters: Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon Cooper (Jim Parsons), two physicists who work at Caltech and share an apartment; Penny (Kaley Cuoco), a waitress and aspiring actress who lives across the hall; and Howard Wolowitz (Simon Helberg) and Raj Koothrappali (Kunal Nayyar), their friends and co-workers who are also scientists. The season focuses on Leonard's crush on Penny and his attempts to impress her, while Sheldon struggles to cope with Penny's presence and his own eccentricities. Howard and Raj provide comic relief with their antics and failed attempts to woo women.
 
The first season consists of 17 episodes, which were aired from September 24, 2007 to May 19, 2008. The season received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and the premise but criticized the stereotypical portrayal of nerds and the lack of originality. The season averaged 8.31 million viewers per episode and ranked 68th in the ratings. The season finale, "The Tangerine Factor", featured Leonard and Penny going on their first date, which ends in disaster when they realize they have nothing in common.
 
Some trivia for season 1:
 
- The pilot episode was filmed twice, with different actresses playing Penny. The original pilot featured Amanda Walsh as Katie, a cynical and street-smart woman who befriends Leonard and Sheldon. The pilot was rejected by CBS, who asked for a more likable female lead. The second pilot featured Kaley Cuoco as Penny, a sweet and bubbly waitress who dreams of becoming an actress. The second pilot was accepted by CBS and became the first episode of the series.
- The theme song of the show, "Big Bang Theory Theme", was written and performed by the Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies. The song summarizes the history of the universe in less than 20 seconds, from the big bang to the present day.
- The title of each episode is a reference to a scientific concept or phenomenon that is related to the plot or the characters. For example, "The Luminous Fish Effect" refers to a type of fish that glows in the dark, which Sheldon uses to create a night light after he loses his job.

## Season 2 (2008-2009)
 
The second season of The Big Bang Theory expands on the relationships between the characters and introduces new recurring characters. Leonard and Penny continue to explore their feelings for each other, while Sheldon meets a potential love interest in Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), a fellow physicist who shares his passion for science but not his personality. Howard meets Bernadette Rostenkowski (Melissa Rauch), a microbiologist who works with Penny at The Cheesecake Factory. Raj develops a crush on Abby (Danica McKellar), a girl he meets at a speed dating event.
 
The second season consists of 23 episodes, which were aired from September 22, 2008 to May 11, 2009. The season received more positive reviews from critics, who praised the improved writing, the chemistry between the cast, and the guest appearances by celebrities such as Summer Glau, George Smoot, Stan Lee, and Stephen Hawking. The season averaged 10.01 million viewers per episode and ranked 44th in the ratings. The season finale, "The Monopolar Expedition", featured Leonard leaving for an expedition to the North Pole with Sheldon,
